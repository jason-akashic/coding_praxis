# - Enhanced context sufficiency verification
# - Stricter file tracking requirements
# - More explicit file request sequences

# GROK-SPECIFIC MEMORY MANAGEMENT
# - File sharing memory protocols
# - User-provided file tracking
# - Context retention for shared files
# - Memory optimization for file-heavy sessions

# GROK-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PATTERNS
# - File request formatting
# - User file sharing acknowledgment
# - Context building protocols
# - File dependency tracking

# GROK-SPECIFIC ERROR HANDLING
# - Missing file error protocols
