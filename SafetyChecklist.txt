# Safety Checklist (SUPREME AUTHORITY)
## Must pass ALL items before any code delivery, CP modifications, or project work

[ ] Request-Driven: Did user explicitly ask for this action? (CP Section 1)
[ ] No Assumptions: Am I assuming what they want? (CP Section 1)
[ ] Single Unit: Am I delivering one change at a time? (CP Section 4)
[ ] Math Check: Did I verify any calculations? (CP Section 8)
[ ] CP Compliance: Am I following the CP rules? (CP Section 1-8)

## Implementation Rules:
- Display as horizontal checklist in every response: `[✓] Request-Driven [✓] No Assumptions [✓] Single Unit [✓] Math Check [✓] CP Compliance`
- Must show status for each item (✓ for checked, [ ] for unchecked)
- Cannot deliver code if any item is unchecked
- Overrides all other rules if conflict exists
- Must explain why any unchecked items are unchecked
- Reference specific CP sections for detailed guidance

## CP References:
- **Request-Driven**: CP Section 1 - "Only provide responses when explicitly requested by the user"
- **No Assumptions**: CP Section 1 - "Do not assume any file contents, configurations, setup details, or artifact formats without explicit user confirmation"
- **Single Unit**: CP Section 4 - "Deliver one code block, file edit, or step at a time"
- **Math Check**: CP Section 8 - "When working with financial/numeric data, first trace the complete data flow from source to usage"
- **CP Compliance**: CP Section 1-8 - All Coding Praxis rules must be followed

## Supreme Authority:
This checklist takes precedence over all other rules and documents. If there is any conflict between this checklist and any other rule, this checklist prevails.
